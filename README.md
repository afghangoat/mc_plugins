#My minecraft plugin source codes.

Contains the source codes of most of my plugins. I made these for Spigot and Paper 1.16.5. Compilation for that version should be trivial.

##Plugins by name

- **Mars world generator**: Generates mars-like terrain with a bit of fantasy.
- **Coruscant world generator**: Generates an infinite city based on Coruscant form Star Wars. (Unfinished)
- **MKWG**: Meinkraft world generator is the world generator of my old survival server.
- **Planet-4 world generator**: Generates the terrain AND the terrain ONLY from Alien's planet-4. The trees, structures were generated by a propertiary plugin that I sadly do not own the rights of.
- **RandomDisguise**: Adds an alias to a command which randomly disguises you to a mob. It builds upon the libsDisguises plugin.
- **TestWorldgen**: A basic plains and forest generator for Bukkit.
- **Tws-Propper**: Used to tweak vanilla generation on my server and place "cliffs" everywhere.

##Usage

Link to Spigot 1.16.5 and compile them.

I hope these source codes help you in a way!
